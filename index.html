        <p>Spunky. Driven. Funny. A little obsessed with weight lifting. At times a bit too honest. Those are just
         some of the words I use when asked to describe myself. I love a good joke, soccer, classic novels, and 
         hiking, but my all-time favorite way to spend my time is making memories with my husband 
         and 3 kids (ages 7, 4, and 1).
        </p>
        <p>Professionally I started out as an educator, teaching at a rural elementary school in Northern Utah. 
        It was fulfilling, fun, and challenging.  I stopped teaching when my husband’s schooling took us overseas 
        to Israel for two years.  Upon return to the States I began my own health coaching business. I have loved 
        giving people the tools they need to successfully meet their goals. I’ve taken that passion and applied it
         to web development. Now I create the tools needed to help both businesses and individuals succeed.
